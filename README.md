<h1>Iris Flower Classification</h1>
This project is a machine learning model built to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using the famous Iris dataset. The model is created and trained using Google Colab and deployed on GitHub.

📊 Dataset
The Iris dataset contains:

150 samples

4 features:

Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

3 Classes:

Setosa (0)

Versicolor (1)

Virginica (2)

✅ The dataset is included in the sklearn.datasets library.

🔥 Model Performance
The model achieved the following metrics:

Accuracy: ~97%

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report.

📈 Visualization
Sample plots showing the distribution of the Iris classes:

Pairplot: Shows the relationship between different features.

Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the model's predictions.

🚀 Future Improvements
Implement hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

Use Cross-validation for more reliable model evaluation.

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
